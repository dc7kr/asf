/**
 * \mainpage Low Power and QTouch Demo for SAM4L
 *
 * \section Purpose
 *
 * The Low Power and QTouch demo will help new users get familiar with Atmel's
 * SAM4L microcontrollers. This basic application shows how to initialize
 * the QTouch library and optimize the SAM4L configuration to target low power
 * applications.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - main.c demo application,
 * - app.c manage SAM4L low-level configuration
 * - gui.c manage QTouch, push button, LCD display and Board Monitor transfers.
 *
 * \section Requirements
 *
 * This package can be used with SAM4L-EK evaluation kits.
 *
 * \section Description
 *
 * - At startup the application run in full demo mode (all features on, includes 
 * QTouch and segment LCD). The applications captures QTouch inputs 
 * (sliders and CS0 QTouch button): displays the slider value (0..255)  to the 
 * segment LCD, CS0 will change the SAM4L Power Scaling mode (PS0 or PS1). 
 * - Once the PB0 push button has been pressed, the application switches in low 
 * power mode: Stop LCD controller, stop LCD backlight, stop QTouch 
 * acquisition, switch SAM4L in power scaling PS1 mode. SAM4L is still in RUN mode.
 * - If PB0 is pressed, the SAM4L will enter one of  the sleep modes 
 * (from RUN to WAIT to RET to BACKUP, then restart to RUN). For each sleep mode 
 * transition, the SAM4L is sending the information to the board monitor 
 * (over the USART). The current SAM4L sleep mode is displayed by the board 
 * monitor on the OLED display.
 *
 * \section Usage
 *
 * - Build the program and download it to the evaluation board. Please
 *  refer to the SAM4L main page documentation http://www.atmel.com/tools/SAM4L-EK.aspx
 * - Start the application.
 * - The message "SAM4L-EK DEMO" is scrolling on SAM4L-EK on-board LCD segment.
 * - Play with QTouch and push button.
