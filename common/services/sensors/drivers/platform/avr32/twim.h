 * \brief Atmel AVR32 TWI Master Bus Interfaces
 *
 * This module provides general access to the Atmel two-wire master (TWIM)
 * bus interface implemented on UC3L and UC3A3 microcontrollers.  It is a
 * lightweight replacement to the Atmel Software Framework drivers for the
 * TWIM interface on a given part.  The Common Sensors API Service will use
 * this module unless the \c CONF_CUSTOM_BUS configuration constant is defined
 * for an application build.
