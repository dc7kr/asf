 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * This application performs a multi-step manual calibration on a compass
 * (magnetometer) sensor device.  The device must be physically manipulated
 * during the calibration process, between individual steps.  The user
 * presses the button on the processor board to move to the next calibration
 * step.

/*! \brief Compass / magnetometer calibration application
 *
 * This application illustrates the use of the sensor_calibrate() function
 * for compass/magnetometer calibration.  It prompts the user (via serial
 * output) to manipulate the sensor board and press a button to continue.
 *
 * The calibration process is used to correct for fixed magnetic forces
 * present on the board where the compass is mounted.  If uncorrected, these
 * fixed forces will prevent accurate measurement of the actual external
 * magnetic forces (e.g. magnetic North).
 *
 * The calibration sequence requires three steps.  During each step, the
 * board is placed in a specific orientation, and the user presses the button
 * on the board to trigger a compass sensor reading.
 *
 * The three orientations are:
 *   -#  Board lying flat (on a table, for example).
 *   -#  Board rotated 180 degrees (end-for-end), still lying flat.
 *   -#  Board flipped (inverted) so that the opposite side is facing up.
 *
 * After Step 3 is completed, the calibration values for the sensor are
 * calculated and are written to non-volatile (flash) memory on the
 * microcontroller.  These values will continue to be used for future
 * compass heading readings.
 *
 * \return  Nothing.
